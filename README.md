## Sectie 2: Setup of the Lab Environment and Course Resources
3. Precursor: Installing Docker
```bash
#April 12th 2021 Update

#In the next video, 'Installing Docker', when Installing 'Docker Desktop' for either Mac or Windows, please use v3.2.2 as per the following links and not v3.3.0 -

#https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/release-notes/
#https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/release-notes/

#The v3.3.0 release causes an issue in the course lab images where devices in /dev such as /dev/null, have incorrect permissions, causing issues for non-root users.  These #issues relate to an updated Kernel in the latest Docker Desktop release.

#There is an updated version of the lab environment that resolves this issue and during the video 'Installing the Ansible Lab' you can use the 'release-candidate' branch from github at the time should you wish to try this.  As this is tested further, I will make the new images the default and will remove this message.

#In summary.  If you're looking for consistency when running the course, please use v3.2.2 of Docker Desktop, otherwise, when using v3.3.0 use the release-candidate branch for the lab in 'Installing the Ansible Lab'

#Best Regards

#James Spurin
```
4. Installing Docker
- Docker Desktop installation for Mac or Windows
- Docker installation for Linux
```bash
sudo curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker <username> (e.g. provision user)
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
/user/local/bin/docker-compose
/user/local/bin/docker-compose version
```
5. Installing the Ansible Lab
Source material: https://github.com/spurin/diveintoansible-lab
From user directory do:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spurin/diveintoansible-lab.git
cd ~ 
cd diveintoansible-lab
change CONFIG and ANSIBLE_HOME directories which fits your user folder, check with pwd
```
6. Configuring SSH connectivity between hosts
Check in ~/.ssh/known_hosts for existing accepted keys
```bash
  ssh-keygen -H -F ubunutu1 # ubuntu1 is the server name and check the name with a key in known_hosts
```
or
```bash
  ssh-keygen -H -F 192.168.3.1
```

Create private and public key
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "j.derix@johnderix.nl"
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
```

Copy public key to sa erver to login passwordless
```bash
ssh-copy-id <username>@<servername>
```

From Ansible Master
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sshpass
echo password > password.txt

for user in ansible root
do
  for os in ubuntu centos
  do
    for instance 1 2 3
    do
      sshpass -f password.txt ssh-copy-id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ${user}@${os}${instance}
    done
  done
done
```

Remove password file
```bash
rm password.txt
```

Test access by executing ping:
```bash
ansible -i,ubuntu1,ubuntu2,ubuntu3,centos1,centos2,centos3 all -m ping

rm .ssh/known_hosts
```
7. Setting up the Course Repository
Course Code Repository: https://github.com/spurin/diveintoansible
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spurin/diveintoansible.git # on Ansible Master ubuntu-c in user directory ~
ls 
```
8. Section 1 & 2 Quiz

## Sectie 3: Ansible Architecture and Design
9. Ansible Configuration
```bash
ansible --version
```
Ansible Configuration Files
Highest priority first
- ANSIBLE_CONFIG=<path to ansible.cfg file>
make variabele by
```bash
export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/home/provision/my_ansible_config_file.cfg
ansible --version
unset ANSIBLE_CONFIG
```
- ./ansible.cfg (An ansible.cfg file, in the current directory)
- ~/.ansible.cfg (A hidden file, called .ansible.cfg, in the users home directory)
- /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg (Typically provided, through packaged or system installation of Ansible)

Changes to the Ansible Release Process

Recently, Ansible's release approach has changed and Ansible is now a bundle consisting of what is known as 'Ansible-Base' (the Core Ansible Executable) and common 'Ansible Collections' (the built-in modules).

This latest update of the course has Ansible 3.2.0 installed within the lab environment.

When running 'ansible --version' you will notice that the version is listed as '2.10.7'.  This is referring to the Ansible-Base version that is provided and is not the Ansible release.

You can verify that the installed version of Ansible is 3.2.0 by running the following command -

ansible@ubuntu-c:~$ pip3 freeze | grep ansible
ansible==3.2.0
ansible-base==2.10.7

I hope this helps with any confusion that may have arisen between the course listing the version as Ansible v3 and the --version output showing 2.10.7

### 12. Ansible Modules
### Idempotency, an operation is idempotent, if the result of performing it once, is exactly the same as the result of performing it repeatedly without any intervening actions.
```bash
# Setup module for gathering facts
ansible all -m setup -o
# File module
ansible all -m file -a 'path=/tmp/test state=touch'
ansible all -m file -a 'path=/tmp/test state=file mode=600'
# Copy module
touch /tmp/x
ansiblle all -m copy -a 'src=tmp/x dest=/tmp/x' # Source = ansible host
ansiblle all -m copy -a 'remote_src=yes src=tmp/x dest=/tmp/y' # Source = remote host
# Command module (doesn't pass shell common variables like $home or redirection operators. If this is needed use shell command module)
ansible all -a 'hostname' -o
ansible all -a 'touch /tmp/test_command_module creates=/tmp/test_command_module' # Only runs if the file doesn't exist
ansible all -a 'rm /tmp/test_command_module removes=/tmp/test_command_module' # Only runs if the file exists
# Fetch module https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/fetch_module.html
ansible all -m file -a 'path=/tmp/test_modules.txt state=touch mode=600' -o
ansible all -m fetch -a 'src=/tmp/test_modules.txt dest=/tmp/' -o # fetch the file back from the remote host to the ansible host
```

## Sectie 4: Ansible Playbooks, Introduction
### 13. Yaml
use .yaml as recommendation extension since 2006, not .yml
Ansible optionally can start with 3 dashes (---) which stand for start and ends with 3 dots (...) which stands for end, but this is not a prerequisite
```bash
# Goto revision 1:
cd /diveintoansible/Ansible Playbooks, Introduction/YAML/01
ls
cat show_yaml_python.sh
./show_yaml_python.sh
cd ../02
cat test.yaml
./show_yaml_python.sh
## you can see that Python is threating this output as a dictionary, we know this at the curly brackets a t the start and the end!
## a dictonairy allows you to lockup the values by the key
python3
myvar = {

cd ../03
cat test.yaml
use double quotes if \n etc is used

key: | # all lines in the dictionairy will get carriage ereturn at the end (\n)
key: > # the last line in the dictionairy will get carriage ereturn at the end (\n)
key: >- # the minus stands for remove last character so no lines, including the last line in the dictionairy will get carriage ereturn at the end (\n)

cd ../08
python3
myvar = {'example_integer': 1}
print(myvar['example_integer'])
output = 1
print(type(myvar['example_integer']))
output = <class Ã­nt'>

cd ../09
# by quoting the value it changes into a string instead of an integer
cat test.yaml # the value is between ""
./show_yaml_output.sh # see how the output is between '' which means a string and not ann integer

cd ../10
## booleans
## Preruiqsite is True or False

cd ../11

## example playbook

## output between [ ]  is a list
## e.g.
---
- Aston Martin
- Fiat
- FOrd
- Vauxhall

## output between { } is a dictionairy
---
Aston Martin:
Fiat:
Ford:
Vauxhall:
...
## add key values to each manufacurer with year

## 14. Ansible Playbooks, Breakdown of Sections
```bash
cat motd_playbook.yaml
cd ../02
cat centos_motd

## Playbook example
---
- The minus in the yaml indicates a list item
  tasks:
    - name: Configure a MOTD
      copy:
        src: centos_motd
        dest: /etc/motd
